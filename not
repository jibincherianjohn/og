Object  Oreinted mProgramming

class -designn/Blueprint/Structure
object - Real world Entity
referrence- to store object  for futher operation (same as varaiable)



...Identifers...
- varaiables
- class name 
- method name

methods attribute to class attrbutes

this - instance keyword  - is ued to create instance varaiable (class attribute)
 
 constructor - is used to intailize object at the time  of object creation

1 Inheritance- used to acess properties(methods& Attribuets) of one class in another class

2 Polymorphism - means  manyforms(many shape)- method overloading(java script dosent support overloading), method overriding

3 Abstraction - hiding background details showing only needed data 

4 Enacapulastion -binding data and code  into single one or unit

   
    ... Inheritance ....
 .. 1 -used to acess properties(methods& Attribuets) of one class in another class or
 one class attain properties of another class

 TYpe of Inhertiance
 1- single Inhertiance - (one base class one child class)
 2- multiple Inhertiance- ( a subclass can inherit from two or more superclasses or mutiple base class  single child ) it doesn't support in java scrpit
 3- multilevel Inhertiance /heriarchical Inhertiance -()

.............   Polymorphism ..........

means  manyforms(many shape)
types
1 - method overloading - same method name but different arguments (java script doentsupport overloading)
2 - method overriding -  base class and derived class  having same method name and  same agruments,-last created method over-rides other method
 
    .......... Abstraction ............ 

     Hiding background details showing only needed data 

     ............ Encapulation.............

Binding data and code  into single one or unit
